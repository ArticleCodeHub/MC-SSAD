# MC_SSAD  
**LSTM Autoencoder-based Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection**

MC_SSAD is an unsupervised hyperspectral anomaly detection method based on an **LSTM Autoencoder**.  
The model learns background spectral representations and detects anomalies using reconstruction-based anomaly scores.

---

## Overview
Hyperspectral anomaly detection aims to identify pixels that significantly differ from the background without requiring labeled anomaly samples.  
MC_SSAD addresses this problem by modeling background characteristics through an autoencoder framework and highlighting pixels with abnormal reconstruction behavior.
